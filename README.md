# Learning_from_data
In this  project, I applied machine learning to a dataset with 5000 samples and 10 features. Each group member uses a different classifier: Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forests, or SVMs, and also develops a neural network. Deliverables include a PowerPoint presentation and a Jupyter notebook.
